# About Me

I am an AI researcher focused on improving human-AI interaction. I've co-led several open-source projects:

- **[AutoGen](https://aka.ms/autogen-gh)**: A Python framework for building agentic AI systems and multi-agent applications. And **[AutoGen Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-studio)**: An interactive no-code interface for prototyping agents.
- **[Magentic-One](https://aka.ms/magentic-one)**: A state-of-the-art multi-agent team for complex tasks built using AutoGen. And **[Magentic-UI](https://github.com/microsoft/magentic-ui)**: A human-centered web agent built using AutoGen and Magentic-One.
- **[MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown)**: A Python tool for converting various files to markdown.
